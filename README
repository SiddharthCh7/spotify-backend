## Features

- Search songs and view details

## Data Storage Architecture

- **Songs and albums metadata** are stored in a MongoDB database for fast search, filtering, and management.
- **Song files** are stored in an AWS S3 bucket for scalable, reliable delivery and cost-efficient storage.
- **Secure access:** To prevent direct access and authorization issues, the backend generates a time-limited signed URL for users to stream or download songs, protecting raw S3 links and maintaining access control.


## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- React.js
- JavaScript (100%)
- MongoDB for data storage
- S3 for media storage

## Future Scope

- **ML-based recommendations**: Leverage user data and listening history to deliver personalized playlists and song suggestions.
- **CDN implementation**: Integrate a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster, geo-distributed song delivery, reducing latency and load on S3 for popular content[web:18].
- **Additional metadata (genres, popularity metrics, lyrics)**
- **Advanced search, podcast support, and analytics dashboards**
